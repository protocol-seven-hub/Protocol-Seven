## ❓ Something Went Wrong?

### "I don't see my files in GitHub"
- Make sure you dragged ALL files
- The icons folder should show as a folder, not individual files
- Try uploading again

### "GitHub Pages says 'None' and won't let me select"
- Your files might not be uploaded yet
- Go back to "Code" tab (top menu)
- Make sure you see index.html and other files
- If not, re-upload

### "Install button doesn't show"
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages (it takes time)
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Make sure you're using HTTPS (your GitHub URL already is)
- Try a different browser

### "It says 404 Not Found"
- Wait a few minutes - GitHub Pages takes 1-2 minutes to activate
- Make sure you copied the full URL including /protocol-seven/ at the end
- Check that Pages is enabled in Settings
